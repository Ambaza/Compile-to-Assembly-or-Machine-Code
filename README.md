# Compile-to-Assembly-or-Machine-Code
Let's create a simple compiler that translates a subset of a high-level language into x86 assembly code. In this example, I'll focus on arithmetic operations and a basic stack-based approach
The AssemblyCompiler class compiles a simple arithmetic expression into x86 assembly code. The generated assembly code includes the necessary sections (data and text) and a global _start label, adhering to the typical structure of an assembly program.

This compiler handles basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and supports nested expressions. The generated assembly code uses the stack for temporary storage during calculations.

A full-fledged compiler would need to handle variables, control flow, and a broader set of language features.
